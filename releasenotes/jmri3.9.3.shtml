      Release Notes for JMRI 3.9.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.9.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>
<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>None at the time of this release.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.2:</h3>

<p>
The Speedometer now handles international format input.  If you live in a place where
decimal numbers are written like "1,3" and JMRI is set to that locale
(see the Locale section on <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Display">this page</a>), 
then use commas when inputing the distances.
We'll be updating more parts of JMRI to do this in the future.

<h4>System Support</h4>
<p>This is the first series of JMRI releases to support the MRC command stations
via the Prodigy USB computer interface.</p>

<p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the Roco Z21 command stations
via it's built in network connection.</b></p>

<h5>RFID</h5>

<h5>OpenLCB</h5>

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>


<h4>Scripting</h4>


   <h4>Operations</h4>
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Improved how the alternate track feature works. You can now use the alternate track feature
     without schedules or custom loads. Note that if you specify an alternate for a spur, only cars
     destined for that spur will be placed on the alternate track.</li>
   </ul>
