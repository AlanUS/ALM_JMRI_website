      Release Notes for JMRI 3.6 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: July 8, 2013</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production version 3.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

We are very pleased to announce that the 3.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 3.6" available for download today.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

This release requires Java 1.6 or later.
<p>
This release no longer supports the Digitrax MS100 on any computer.  If you have an MS100 working
with an earlier release, please stay with that release. You should plan on updating
to a better LocoNet interface before updating to this or any later release.

<p>For users of JMRI on Microsoft Windows, the installer will now request
Administrator permissions if the user running the installation is not a member
of the administrators group. Users of Windows Vista or later may receive a
UAC (User Account Control) pop-up message when installing.</p>

<p>The TCS decoder definitions have been extensively reworked.  
You'll notice that they list different families and the models are 
organized differently.  This is to make the automatic identification 
work much better.  Please let us know if you encounter any problems with this.

<p>This release and all future releases will not support the NCE serial interface running at 19,200 baud. Use the default 9,600 baud instead.</p>

<p>The decoder definition files have been extensively reworked for this release series
to reduce their size and allow  them to be translated to other languages.
Please keep an eye out for any inadvertent changes to the definitions 
that might have been introduced.</p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
