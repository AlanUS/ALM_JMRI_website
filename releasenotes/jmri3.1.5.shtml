<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!

back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.2 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.1.4</h3>

<p>Randall Wood made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added JSON server at port 2056</li>
<li>Added JSON WebSocket services to the web server</li>
</ul>

<p>Steve Todd made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed Linux startup script to distinguish hard vs. soft float arm libraries.</li>
<li>Added Operations data to json servers (trains, locations, engines, cars).</li>
<li>Initial version of browser-based Operations functions (train list and manifest).</li>
<li>Fixed issue with WiThrottle handling of wildcard multi-throttles (seen with EngineDriver only).</li>
</ul>

<p>Enzo Fortuna provided an full Italian translation.  (There are still a few bits
of English that will require some code changes)

<p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The schedules window status has been improved to show more cases where a schedule has a problem.</li>
<li>The edit train window will now only launch one edit route window</li>
<li>Train reset in the Trains window now checks to see if the departure staging track was allocated to another in bound train.
This prevents using reset for the departure train, and then ending up with two trains on the same staging track.</li>
</ul>
