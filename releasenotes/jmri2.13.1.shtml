<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.14 or 3.0 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>
