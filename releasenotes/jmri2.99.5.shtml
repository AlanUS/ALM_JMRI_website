<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.0 production release, probably in Summer 2012.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 2.99.4</h3>

<p>Nigel Cliffe updated the MERG ACC5 decoder definition to fix a problem with
indexed variables.</p>

<p>Matthew Harris made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Updated the Lenz Gold decoder definition making the SUSI transport CV (CV127) write-only.</li>
    <li>Added the option to allow an 'Open Roster' button to be added to the main JMRI window.</li>
    <li>Added the option to enable the Roster to be automatically opened at start-up.</li>
</ul>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Fixed a problem introduced in 2.99.4 with the switch list button "Print Switch List Changes".</li>
    <li>New feature, auto backup.  When enabled, the program will make a backup copy of all operation
    files when the program starts.</li>
    <li>Two new switch list features.  You can now eliminate trains that don't have work from your switch lists.
    You can if you wish use a separate page for each train visiting a location.  See help for more info.</li>
    <Li>You can now view a car's wait value in the Cars window.  Note that you need a schedule for this field
    to show up.</Li>
    <LI>Fixed a problem when manually adding a car to a train when the train is a turn.</LI>
    <li>Enhanced the cars print and preview options. Now you can select the page orientation, and you can also 
    optionally select the car's train, destination, and comment.
    <li>You can now print all of your routes from the "Tools" menu found in the routes window.
    </ul>
    
<p>Kevin Dickerson made the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased the number items used to identify a roster entry in DP3 to include 
        Decoder manufacture, version and address type used.</li>
        <li>Fixed a problem introduced in 2.99.4 with the saving/loading of a layout panel that had a
        level crossing included.</li>
        <li>Added initial support for DCC4PC RailCom interface boards.  The interface is currently <b>not supported in Windows</b></li>
        <li>Made some changes to the internal workings of the new Slips in the Layout Editor, this means that any added 
            in 2.99.4 will have to be re-created or put a request up on the yaho group for assistance</li>
        <li>Updated the memory icon in the panels so that if a roster entry is allocated against it, the roster media icon is displayed (if available) or the roster title. If an icon and throttle is available the icon will flip to match the direction</li>
        <li>Added a script ("AllocateRosterEntryToBlock.py) that allows you to allocate a roster entry to a block</li>
        <li>Added in the ability to allow an Entry Exit become a variable condition to a Logix.</li>
        <li>Added in ability to the layout editor to hide turnouts when not in editing mode</li>
        <li>Allow the following fields to be directly edited in the DP3 roster table, when the entry is not already opened
        <ul><li>ID Col</li>
        <li>Road Name</li>
        <li>Road Number</li>
        <li>Manufacturer</li>
        <li>Model</li>
        <li>Owner</li></ul>
        This does mean that the double click option to open the programmer can now only be performed on the DCC Address, Icon or Decoder Model columns</li>
    </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Replace the Mini Web Server with a Jetty-based Web Server</li>
    <li>Add a Roster servlet that handles most roster-based operations</li>
    <li>Updated the index.html file to be more operations-oriented</li>
    <li>Added a Panel servlet that provides a partial panel XML file with correct URLs for remote panel widgets</li>
    <li>Streamlined existing servlets to make feature expansion easier in the future</li>
