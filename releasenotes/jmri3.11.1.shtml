      Release Notes for JMRI 3.11.1 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, YYYY</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.11.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2015.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<P>This release, and all later releases in this cycle, require Java 1.8 or higher.
To use this or any later JMRI releases, you'll have to 
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">update the Java on your computer</a> to Java 1.8 or higher.
</p>

<P>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects.</P>

<p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and 
for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those 
defaults were set properly.

<p> If you are making a direct connection to a Intellibox unit via
    serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
    See the 
    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a> 
    for instructions.

<p>Because of internal code changes, this version of JMRI is not compatible with
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/">CATS 2.34</a> or earlier.  Keep using 
<a href="jmri3.10.shtml">JMRI 3.10</a> with CATS until there's a CATS update that
says it will work with JMRI 3.11.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been removed. All users who were relying on the
XmlIO API are recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle
users are recommended to begin using webThrottle instead, or invest in devices
that can support webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine
Driver.</p>


<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>None at the time of this release.</p>

<h3>Changes since production release 3.10:</h3>

<p>This release was built with Java 1.8, which is now required for JMRI.</P>

<P>This release uses JDOM 2.0.5, which requires some code changes if you are directly
calling the parts of JMRI that interchange XML objects. There's more information
in the
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml#jdom2">migration section of the JMRI Tech Road Map</a>.</P>


<h4>Hardware Support</h4>

    <p>There are now separate settings for the default Service Mode Programmer and 
    for the default Ops Mode Programmer.  If you're using two or more system connections,
    this lets you use one connection for ops mode (on track) programming and another connection
    for your programming track. If you're using two separate connections, you
    should go to the Defaults pane on the Preferences window and check that those 
    defaults were set properly. Some tools, like the Single CV Programmer and 
    the DecoderPro main windows, will also allow you to select which system to use
    instead of relying on just the default setting.
  
    <h5>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</h5>
        <p>The Uhlenbrock Intellibox support has been improved:
        <ul>
        <li>Enhancements to Loconet Monitor to parse the special IB-COM CV programming messages.
        <li>Implementation of CV programming through IB-COM / Intellibox II. 
        <li>Turnout control added for some Intellibox command stations
        <li>Improved handling of decoder functions from throttles beyond F8 for Intellibox-I and -II.
        <li>Improvements in message transfer from and to the LocoNet connection
        </ul>
        <p>As part of this, the Fleishmann connection type has been merged into
            the Uhlenbrock type.  
            If you are making a direct connection to your Intellibox unit via
            serial or USB, you will have to reselect your preferences.
            See the 
            <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/Uhlenbrock.shtml">Uhlenbrock support page</a> 
            for instructions.
        
<h4>Signals</h4>

    <p>The aspects.xml file in each signal definition defines the speeds used for automated operation.
    These values are now required (by the schema check) for a valid XML file.  Basic values
    have been added for all signal systems included in JMRI.

<h4>Layout Editor</h4>


<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

    <h5>SoundTraxx</h5>
        <p>SoundTraxx now appears in the manufacturer list as "SoundTraxx (Throttle-Up)" 
        instead of the original "Throttle-Up (SoundTraxx)". It's a long story....

    <h5>TCS</h5>
        <p>Michael Mosher updated the TCS WOW definition.</p>

    <h5>ESU</h5>
        <p>Mathias Rufer and Dave Heap added an ESU LokPilot Standard V1.0 definition.</p>

   <h4>Operations</h4>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>When a car is placed at a spur with a custom load of type "Empty", the program now
     changes the car's load name to the default load name "L".</li>
    <LI>Improvements to the "Timetable" window to allow the building, printing, and termination
     of selected trains. Also allows for the updating or printing of switch lists. This should help
     simplify things when building and terminating multiple sets of trains for a session.</LI>
    <LI>You can now print out all location and track comments using the print tool under
     "Locations".</LI>
    <LI>New switch list option to print out a new sheet of paper each time a train visits a
     location.</LI>
   </ul>

   <h4>Warrants</h4>

   <p>Pete Cressman made the following changes to warrants:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug #481 "Warrant Logix not working as of 3.7.2".  Warrants can be executed from
    Logix.</li>
    <li>Warrant command "Run Warrant" that allows one warrant to launch another is now fully 
    implemented.</li>
   </ul>
