	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2013</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.7.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.8 production release around the middle of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since production release 3.6:</h3>

    
<p>OpenLCB library updated to better handle hub operations.

<p>Several internal updates for how CV reading and writing is changed 
to improve handling of indexed CVs.  If you have your own code or scripts
that write or read CVs directly, check to see if we've broken anything, please.

<p>Improved the handling of decoders that contain only long addresses, no short addresses.

<p>Peter Ulvestad updated the Hornby 8249 default values.

<p>Nigel Cliffe and Dave Heap fixed problems with international characters in four Python scripts:
AAR105.py, 
RailDriver.py, 
RocoCrane46902.py, 
Zimo_pseudo_programmer.py

<p>Added sample scripts:<ul>
<LI><a a href="http://jmri.org/jython/SensorToTurnout.py">jython/SensorToTurnout.py</a>: takes Sensor inputs from an external system and maps them to Internal turnouts
<LI><a a href="http://jmri.org/jython/SignalHeadFromSensors.py ">jython/SignalHeadFromSensors.py</a>: takes Sensor inputs from e.g. an external signal system and drives SignalHead objects
</ul>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following chnages to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The data in operations files has changed with this release. Previously the files
     contained backward compatibility elements so that you could load a file created with the latest
     release and read it back using one of the very early releases of operations. Now the backward
     compatibility is limited to releases 3.4 and 3.6. In any case, you can always upgrade to a newer release
     of operations, it is only the ability to go back to an older version of the program using the
     latest data files that has been changed.</li>
    <li>New feature, you can now let the program create your locomotive consists for you. See <a
     a
     href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/operations/Operations.shtml#TrainBuildOptions">Train
      Build Options</a> "Build loco consist from single locos if needed" for more details. The program
     when building the consist can adjust the number of locos based on Horsepower per Ton (HPT) and
     the route's grades.
    <li>New feature, you can now adjust all of your train departure times by a selected number
     of hours. See under "Tools" in the "Trains" window "Change Train Departure Times".</li>
     <li>The train edit window now shows if there are road or load restrictions for the train.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in track copy where the car types serviced weren't copied to the new track.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in train copy where the train build options weren't copied to the new
     train.</li>
   </ul>
