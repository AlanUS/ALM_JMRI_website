      Release Notes for JMRI 4.1.1 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: mmm dd, 2015</p>
	<p>From: (pumpkin)</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 4.1.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2015.</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at release time.

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<A href="jmri4.1.2.shtml">JMRI 4.1.2</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or pick up a
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  The definitions
included with this release have all been converted to the new form.
If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
Please ask on the
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">jmriusers list</a>
for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.0.shtml">JMRI 4.0 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.1 development series.

<h3>Changes since test release 4.0:</h3>

    <h4>Hardware Support</h4>

        <p>Improved error handling during start-up when something Really Unexpected
            happens, such as configuring to connect to a port that doesn't even exist.</p>
            
        <h5>C/MRI</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>You can now connect to your C/MRI nodes via a
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/cmri/CMRI.shtml#net">network connection</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>OpenLCB</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The OpenLCB library advanced to version 0.6.7, which (among other things)
                    fixed a problem when trying to read broken configuration definition info
                    from a node.</li>
                <li>The basic work to allow programming of OpenLCB Nodes via the 
                    DecoderPro infrastructure is in place.  Later updates will 
                    connect this to DecoderPro itself.</li>
                <li>A basic 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/downloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">bootloader</a>
                    is available for attached OpenLCB nodes.
                    This lets you install new firmware in a compatible node from
                    a local .hex file (provided by the node manufacturer). Nobody 
                    has announced nodes that use this feature, but hopefully if we 
                    built it they will come.s
            </ul>

        <h5>SPROG</h5>
            <ul>

            <ul>
            </ul>

    <h4>Signals</h4>
    	<h5>Signal Mast Editor</h5>

    			<li>Ken Cameron fixed editing of signal head masts to also support old format panel files.</li>
    		</ul>

    <h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

        <h5>ESU</h5>
        <p>Dave Heap made the following changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Added the "Random Single Strobe" effect to Function Outputs.</li>
            <li>Added the LokSound Select OEM.</li>
            <li>Added some new ProductIDs for correct decoder identification.</li>
            <li>Fixed the sense of the Adaptive Regulation Frequency bit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>MERG</h5>
             <ul>
             <li>The MERG ACC5 definition has been converted to the
             modern format of internal variables from the older
             "ivariable" form.
             </ul>

        <h5>QSI</h5>
             <ul>
<!-- 
             <li>All QSI decoder definitions have been converted to the
             modern format of their internal variables from the older
             "ivariable" form.
 -->
             <li>A problem with the "Max Bell" and "Bell Select"
             variables in several QSI definitions was fixed.
             </ul>

        <h5>RR-CirKits</h5>
             <ul>
             <li>The LNCP Basic definition has been converted to the
             modern format of internal variables from the older
             "ivariable" form.
             </ul>

        <h5>SoundTraxx</h5>
             <ul>
               <li>Michael Mosher added the Econami range.</li>

        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved the script editor (Panels -&gt; Script Entry):

                <li>Now remembers the selected directory from operation to operation,
                    so you don't have to renavigate each time.
                <li>Use the same file selector for Load and Store, so it's
                    easy to work in one directory.
                <li>Use a proper Store dialog so you can e.g. change the
                    filename.

                and providing a local XML catalog.</li>
            <li>Sonny Hansen has greatly improved the Danish translation.</li>
            <li>The Multiple Decoder Programming tool is back to being available
                in the DecoderPro tools menu.  Also, you can add it as a button or 
                startup item in PanelPro and DecoderPro.</li>
            <li>The Danish translations has been made more general. It was coded as
                _da_DK, which is "Danish (Denmark)".  That's been changed to _da, which 
                is generic "Danish", no matter where spoken.  If you have local translation
                files for Danish, this might conflict. Contact the JMRI list for help
                with this. Contributed translations are always welcome!</li>
            <li>The "Check XML File" option under the PanelPro Debug menu didn't need
                to be a separate item, as it was already included in "Validate XML File".
                It's been removed, please select the "Validate XML File" from now on.</li>
            <li>You can now add "Validate XML File" as a custom button via the Start Up pane
                in the Preferences.</li>
        </ul>
