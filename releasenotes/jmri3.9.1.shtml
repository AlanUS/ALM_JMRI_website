<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the MRC command stations
via the Prodigy USB computer interface.</b></p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>Changes since production release 3.8:</h3>

When you set a non-default location for script files under the preferences "location" tab, e.g. to put your scripts
in a common directory, that location can now be referenced via the "scripts:" portable prefix.  This will be applied
automatically to pathnames that are selected when defining Logix Conditional Actions and similar operations.
Note that if you select a location that <u>doesn't</u> contain the JMRI-supplied scripts, they won't be accessible
through the scripts: prefix, but still will be accessible using program:jython/ as a prefix.

<p>Suzie Tall improved icon support in the
