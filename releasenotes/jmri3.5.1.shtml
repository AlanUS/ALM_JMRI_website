<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!

back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since production release 3.4:</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New two column format for car pick ups and set outs. Go to the Manifest Print Options,
     and under Message Format, select "Two Column" if you want your manifest and switch lists to use
     two columns, one for pickups and one for set outs. The color options for pick up and set outs
     aren't available when using this format.</li>
    <li>You can now modify all of the manifest and switch lists text. See under Manifest Print
     Options, Tools, "Edit Manifest Text" and "Edit Switch List Text".</li>
    <li>Improved text line wrapping for comments in the Conductor and Yardmaster windows.</li>
   </ul>

   <ul>
      <li>SignalMasts - Improved support for SignalMast unlit for DCC/LNCP & Turnout based masts - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMasts - Corrected the way in which a unlit/lit signal mast icon is displayed on a panel - KD</li>
      <li>SignalMasts - Add an option to allow a default DCC accessory aspect ID to be recorded against a given aspect in a signalling system - KD</li>
      <li>Layout Editor - Change the block edit so that it is now possible to access all of the properties of the block, and not just those items that specifically relate to a layout block. - KD</li>
      <li>Blocks - Remove the dependency for a block to have a valid sensor to move an object about, but use the occupancy state of the neighbouring blocks instead. - KD</li>
     </ul> 
     
    <p>Suzie Tall provided support for three new signal systems:
        <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/CROR-2008/index.shtml">CROR-2008</a> from Transport Canada,
        <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/InfraBel-2013/index.shtml">InfraBel-2013</a> from Belgium and
        <a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals/ProRail-1954/index.shtml">ProRail-1954</a> from the Netherlands.
