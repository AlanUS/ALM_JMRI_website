      Release Notes for JMRI 3.9.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.9.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>
<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<p>The activation.jar library is no longer included with the JMRI download.
This shouldn't have any impact on you, but it's remotely possible that it
might impact you if you have your own Java code that you're combining with JMRI
and/or you're still using a Java version before Java 1.6.
(Scripts and panel files will not be impacted.)</p>

<p>Images associated with roster entries are now saved to the roster directory instead of
the resources directory when added to the roster entry. Existing images are not moved.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<!-- keep this warning in place through the 3.11/3.12 development cycle -->
<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11 (July 2015).
All users and developers who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, <a href="http://withrottle.com">WiThrottle</a> for iOS, or
<a href="http://enginedriver.rrclubs.org">Engine Driver</a> for Android.</p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>None at the time of this release.</p>

<h3>Download links:</h3>

<p>During development leading to the actual release, you can find test download files on the 
<a href="http://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">continuous integration build page</a>.
These are development files, and might not be working at any particular time. Make sure the
builds status shows as OK before attempting to use one.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.3:</h3>

<p>

<h4>System Support</h4>
<ul>
	<li>LocoNet: no longer ignore slot responses that don't immediately follow a slot request.
	        Other hardware can insert messages, which were causing lost acquisitions in software throttles. (Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>LocoNet: if no response to slot request, retry, then call failure method if still no response.  
	        Handles Slot Max error, for example. (Steve Todd)</li>
</ul>	

<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>

<h4>Scripting</h4>
<ul>
	<li>in AbstractAutomaton (used by some scripts), cancel throttle requests after failure or timeout so that 
		subsequent retries can complete (Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>change AutoDispatcher2.py to retry on acquisition failure or timeout (Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>Two new sample scripts for the LocoNet Find operation:
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/LnFindTransponder.py">LnFindTransponder.py</a> and
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/LnFindTransponderField.py">LnFindTransponderField.py</a>.</li>
	<li>Script to use fascia button to release/hold signal (e.g. for automated train) 
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/HoldSignalForSensor.py">HoldSignalForSensor.py</a>(Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>Script to use fascia button to control loco functions (horn, bell, etc.) 
	    <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/ThrottleFunctionForSensor.py">ThrottleFunctionForSensor.py</a>(Steve Todd)</li>
	<li>Script to check the status of C/MRI node polling, e.g. to detect a powered-off node, and
	    set into sensors for display on panels: <a href="http://jmri.org/jython/CmriNodeMonitor.py">CmriNodeMonitor.py</a>
</ul>

   <h4>Operations</h4>
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You can now select the type of sort you want directly in the car roster print or
     preview window.</li>
    <li>The program now prints out the entire location and track name when printing or
     previewing your car roster. Previously the program limited the number of print characters to
     38.</li>
    <li>Some additional improvements to the train build report.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem were cars in a kernel weren't correctly redirected from an alternate
     track. Thanks to David Waraxa for finding and reporting this problem.</li>
   </ul>


   <h4>Web Server and Web Throttles</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>Fixed error introduced in 3.8 that sometimes prevented a Panel from linking to another Panel (Randall Wood)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Joan de Castro improved the Catalan translation.</li>
    <li>Included the pathname of currently loaded panel file to Context output (Matthew Harris)</li>
    <li>Added the possibility to include both the currently loaded panel file and
        relevant files from active profile when uploading debugging info (Matthew Harris)</li>
</ul>
