      Release Notes for JMRI 3.3.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2013</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.3.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.4 production release at mid-year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The decoder definition files have been extensively reworked for this release
to reduce their size and allow  them to be translated to other languages.
Please keep an eye out for any inadvertent changes to the definitions 
that might have been introduced.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since test release 3.3.2:</h3>

<p>
Updated the DCC Signal Head to work like the DCC Signal Mast and all known hardware.  The NMRA Standard
for addressing DCC Signal Accessory Decoders is poorly written and ambiguous. JMRI support for these
is moving toward what the hardware manufacturers are actually doing, and away from NMRA DCC Working Group diktat.

<p>
Add LinkingLabel, a type of icon on the various panel editors that will let you move to another window or open a web page.
Just a starting point for eventual web-server features.

<p>
Improvements to aspect-signaling docs.

<p>
Added a new LinkingLabel icon type to the three kinds of panels.  This can be 
text or an icon. When clicked, it takes you to another JMRI window or an external
web page or file.  Steve Todd also built in web support for remote viewing.

<p>
Dick Bronson improved the NS-2008 signal set.

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Yardmaster and Conductor windows now show utility cars by their quantity rather than by
     road and number. Both windows now support the "Sort by Track" option. The Yardmaster window now
     uses the "Switch List" format rather than the "Manifest" format.</li>
    <li>You can now control which loads are allowed to ship from staging.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem when swapping cabooses in a train's route. The code didn't check to see
     if there was the correct number of moves available in the route to do the swap. Thanks to
     Quintin Foster for finding and reporting this problem.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with a train's departure time when there was back to back locations
     using the same name. Thanks to Bob Byck for finding and reporting this issue.</li>
   </ul>
