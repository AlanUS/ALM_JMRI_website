      Release Notes for JMRI 3.3.4 release

	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.3.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.4 production release at mid-year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>This release and all future releases will not support the NCE serial interface running at 19,200 baud.</p>

<p>The decoder definition files have been extensively reworked for this release
to reduce their size and allow  them to be translated to other languages.
Please keep an eye out for any inadvertent changes to the definitions 
that might have been introduced.</p>

<P>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.
