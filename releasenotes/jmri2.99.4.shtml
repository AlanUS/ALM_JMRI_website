<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.0 production release, probably in Summer 2012.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 2.99.3</h3>

   <p>Kevin Dickerson made the following changes.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>(Bug Id 3105034) Fixed an issue with the function labels that would result in default label values that were once removed re-appearing.</li>
   <li>Added in a full Entry/Exit interlocking system for use with the layout editor.</li>
   <li>Suppressed the "Serial Port" selection box from the preferences of the CAN and SMRI Simulator</li>
   <li>Added an automatic connection recovery for the ECoS</li>
   <li>Add the ability for the command monitor, jython input and output windows to be displyaed on top of any other window.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Fixed throttle when launched from Edit NCE Consist and the operations train icon.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the JMRI consist tool to now use the NCE command station when setting up a
     consist.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Increased the maximum sequential car count in a schedule line item from 10 to 100.</li>
    <li>The schedule hit count now includes hits to a line item in sequential mode. Before the
     count would only increment if the schedule was in match mode.</li>
    <li>Some minor GUI improvements, now the program asks if you really want to delete a route
     or a train.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug when deleting a loco, before you couldn't just press the add or save button
     if you changed your mind about deleting the loco.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the switch list printouts. You can now run the switch lists in two modes, real
     time which was the only way it previously ran, and consolidation mode. Consolidation mode is
     great for folks with small railroads. Basically the program allows you to build and terminate
     your trains while capturing the switch list data for a location. See operations help for more
     info. Should save paper!</li>
   </ul>
