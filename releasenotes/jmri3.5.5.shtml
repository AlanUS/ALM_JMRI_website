	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.5.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.5.4:</h3>

<p>Changes to decoder programming and definition allow 
specification of workarounds when a command station only handles a subset of CVs, and
the decoder provides a way to access the full range locally.  Useful with ESU and Zimo
decoders, but not all (close to none) of the decoder definitions have been updated to
use this. 

<p>NCE command station programmer updated to indicate when it can't access high-address CVs.

<p>Dave Heap added automatic display of CV numbers in DecoderPro tooltips.
To see the CV address for a decoder parameter, hover your mouse over it.
By default this is off (DecoderPro exists to hide this information, not show it),
but you can turn in on with a preference under Roster, then Programmer.


   <p>The OpenLCB lib was updated to the current version. This includes several memory-read
    protocol fixes.
   
   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>New feature, the ability to copy any track to a location. See under the Edit Location,
     Tools, "Copy Track".</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with train manifest times when the "same" location was used back to
     back.</li>
    <li>Made some improvements to the train build reports.</li>
    <li>Made some minor improvements to the conductor and yard master windows.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
david zuhn updated the Mac OS X launcher to handle different Java configurations,
particularly when installing a clean version of Mac OS X.

<p>
Bjorn Kvisli and Pierre Billon created multiple Doehler and Haass decoder definitions.
