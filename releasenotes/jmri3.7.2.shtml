      Release Notes for JMRI 3.7.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.7.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.8 production release around the middle of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>The internals for handling CV read and write addressing have been extensively 
reworked.  The change should be transparent (invisible) to users. If you do notice anything 
problems involving CV reading, writing, storage or anything else, please let us know.</p>

<p>The configuration structure for JMRI is changing to use <em>Configuration
Profiles</em>. Configuration Profiles allow a single JMRI application to have
multiple, user selectable, configurations that can be changed as application
startup. For some users, this change will have no impact; other users will be
visibly impacted by this change. See <a
href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml">http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>The JMRI SRCP implementation is undergoing extensive revision, in part
due to testing with 3rd party SRCP clients and servers.  If you are using the SRCP support, you will need to upgrade both the client(s) and the server to the same JMRI version.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<P>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6 or newer.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since test release 3.7.1:</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Made some improvements to car routing and build report messages.</li>
    <li>You can now configure the build report to always preview, saves paper! See Build Report
     Options under Trains-&gt;Tools.</li>
    <li>The program now blocks a kernel for your manifests and switch lists (a group of cars)
     by the order that you add cars to the kernel.</li>
    <li>New checkbox option for the Cars window. Under Tools in the Cars window are two new
     options, one shows the checkboxes, and the other resets the ones showing in the window. Useful
     if your doing an audit of your cars using a PC or portable device. Great for those that don't
     like to waste paper!</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Enzo Fortuna improved the Italian translation.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Machacek added a "Clear all non-in-use Slots" button to the Loconet SlotMonitor.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Machacek updated the WiThrottle server.</p>

<p>Many additions to the 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoderAdvanced.shtml#conditional">tools for structuring conditional decoder definitions</a>.</p>

<p>Matthew Harris updated the user interface font size change preference to no longer override the underlying font style.</p>

<p>Paul Bender updated the JMRI SRCP support in both the client and server to better conform to the letter of the SRCP protocol standard and improve compatability with other SRCP implementations.</p>

<p>Dave Heap improved the display of file locations.</p>

<p>Dave Heap improved the ESU V4 decoder definitions.</p>

<p>Peter Ulvestad updated the clinics information.</p>

<p>Resolved an issue that caused some CVs to be skipped in Read Full Sheet operations. Particularly noticeable with ESU V4 decoders.</p>

<p>Dave Heap added some more NCE menu items to the list of available startup actions and buttons.</p>

<p>The Web server has been extensively updated by Randall Wood and Steve Todd:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The static index.html has been replaced with a home servlet responding to / and /index.html</li>
	<li>The home, panels, and operations servlets have been updated with a new <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> user interface.</li>
	<li>The structure for the servlets resources has been changed to facilitate customization and internationalization.</li>
	<li>The panels servlet uses JSON and WebSockets instead of XMLIO. This may prevent older browsers from receiving asynchronous updates to panels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dave Heap resolved the problem that caused function commands from JMRI or WiThrottles with NCE systems to be sent to seemingly random consist addresses.</p>
