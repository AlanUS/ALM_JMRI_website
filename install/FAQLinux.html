      JMRI: Linux FAQ
      </h1>

<dl>

<dt class="left"><a id="help"/>Has anybody described making all this work?</dt>
<dd class="first">
The main 
<a href="Linux.shtml">JMRI Linux page</a>
has a general list of things you have to do.
<p>
<a href="http://trainguy.dyn.dhs.org/~jminer/dcc/Installing_JMRI_on_RedHat_Fedora_Core_3.html">Jon Miner's web site</a>
provides a nice summary
of installing on Fedora.  
<p>
Robert Plevier has provided a note on his 
<a href="OpenSUSE.shtml">experiences with OpenSUSE</a>.
<p>
</dd>

<dt class="left"><a id="path"/>The "java" command doesn't work. Now what?</dt>
<dd class="first">
<p>Make sure the java bin directory is on the path.  For example,
the default location for the "SDK" 1.4.2_05 version of java is
<code>
/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_05/bin
</code>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt class="left"><a id="sdk"/>What's the difference between the "SDK" and "JRE" java versions?</dt>
<dd class="first">
"SDK" means Software Development Kit.  It's larger, because it contains the compiler
and various development tools.  It also contains everything you need to run
Java programs like JMRI.
<p>
"JRE" means Java Runtime Environment.  It's just the things you need to run
Java programs, not develop them, so it's smaller.
</dd>

<dt class="left"><a id="commlibs"/>Do I need to install the Java comm libraries?</dt>
<dd class="first">
If you want to use JMRI 2.10 or later, you don't need to 
install the Java comm libraries.  With that version, JMRI 
changed to use the RXTX library instead, and JMRI carries
the needed files with it.  If you have the Java comm libraries
installed, you will need to remove them.
<p>
If you want to use JMRI 2.9.1 or earlier, including JMRI 2.8,
you <b>do</b> need to install the Java comm libraries.

</dd>

<dt class="left"><a id="comm"/>Where do I install the Java comm libraries?</dt>
<dd class="first">
<i>This answer is still correct, but no longer needed for JMRI 2.10 or
  later.</i>
<p>
Those libraries need to be installed where they will be found at the java startup.
That means they need to be in the directory associated with the "java" command
you'll be running.
<p>
To find the right version:
<code>
<pre>
   java -version
</pre>
</code>
<p>
Then locate the directories associated with that version.  If you have 
both the "SDK" and "JRE" forms of java installed, it will <i>usually</i>
use the SDK directories, but you might want to install to both.
</dd>

<dt class="left"><a id="usb"/>What do I do if my (USB) serial port isn't 
listed in the preferences?</dt>
<dd class="first">
<p>There are several options for solving this problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>
  <p>With JMRI 2.10 and later, you can set the environment variable
  <b>JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS</b> to a colon-separated list of the additional
  serial port devices you have available.  You can set this in your
  <tt>.bashrc</tt> file (or equivalent for whatever shell you
  use):</p>

  <pre>
  <code>
  export JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS=/dev/nce:/dev/locobuffer
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p>You can also put this into <tt>/etc/profile.d/jmri.sh</tt> if you
  don't want to change your personal <tt>.bashrc</tt> file.</p>

<li>
  <p> If the RxTx and Java Communications Libraries are installed correctly, 
and  the serial port to which your device is attached isn't listed, 
you can force RxTx to recognize a specific serial port.
<p>If you want to force the use of "/dev/ttyUSB0", you can do this by 
adding the following to java command line in the "DecoderPro","PanelPro",
or "JmriDemo" script:
<p>
<pre>
<code>
-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# JMRI 2.10 or later
<br>
-Djavax.comm.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB0 &nbsp;&nbsp; # for 2.8 or earlier
</code>
</pre>
<p> Multiple ports can be added to the list by using a colon separated 
list.
<li>
<p> <i>For JMRI 2.8 and earlier only:</i> If the RxTx and Java Communications Libraries are installed correctly, 
and  the serial port to which your device is attached isn't listed, 
you can force RxTx to recognize a specific serial port.
<p>If you want to force the use of "/dev/ttyUSB0", you can do this by 
adding the following to the "javax.comm.properties":
<p>
<pre>
<code>
javax.comm.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB0
</code>
</pre>
<p> Multiple ports can be added to the list by using a colon separated 
list.
<li>
<p> Finally, if you want RxTx to scan the available ports for you, you can 
modify the source code to do this.  The instructions for doing this are 
included in the INSTALLATION file contained within the RxTx package or
at the <a href="http://rxtx.org/">RXTX home site</a>.</p>
