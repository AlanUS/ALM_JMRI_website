<p>Installation of JMRI on a Ubuntu Linux/GNU system should work on Ubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu (+ Java JDK), Ubuntu and Debian
(The USB port has not been tested under Debian).</p>
<p>GNU/Linux provides a viable alternative to Windows. Is it free and it is also suitable for loading onto older machines
which may no longer have a viable commercial OS.  It is also far less
resource hungry than current Windows distributions and this is particularly true of <a href="http://xubuntu.org">Xubuntu</a> and <a href="http://lubuntu.net">Lubuntu</a>.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is based on Debian and is recognized as being
a very user friendly distribution.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux is becoming increasingly popular as a desktop
operating system. This short instruction deals with installing
JMRI on a Ubuntu (or similar Debian based) desktop.</p>

<a id="installation">
<h2>Installation Procedure</h2></a>

	<ol>
	<li>Determine if your hardware supports Java and JMRI</li>
	  
	<a name="sysreq"></a><h3>JMRI System Requirements</h3>
	<p>Using JMRI requires a combination of hardware (in this case running Linux), Java software and a JMRI download for a specific version.
	<p>JMRI&reg; version 4.2 requires Java 1.8.</p>
	<p>
	You'll need the correct serial port or USB port to attach to your layout hardware. JMRI is compatible with USB-to-Serial adapters, so long as they have Linux drivers that make them look like regular serial ports.</p>
	
	<li>Get and Install Java (if needed)</li>
	
	<p>See if you have a version of Java already installed<p>
	<p class="example"> sh> java -version</p>
	<p>
	If the Java version is 1.8 or later, you may be fine, but be aware that if you did not install Java on your system yourself, some systems have Java only partially installed. They will respond correctly to the above command, but still are not complete. If your system does not have Java in the environment variable PATH, the install is probably not complete. Check with the system manager or do a fresh Java installation.<br>
	If your version is not at least 1.8, or if you get a "java: not found" error, you will need to install it.<br>
	<p>Most Linux distributions can get an automated install download
	from Oracle by clicking on this button:<br>
	<a href="http://java.com/java/download/index.jsp?cid=jdp74834" target="_blank">
	<img src="../images/ico-java.png" width="150" height="150" alt="GetJava Download Button" title="GetJava">
	</a>
	<p>
	You get to a page like<br>
	<img src="images/Ubinstall1.png" width="482" height="237">
	<p>
	Next you download the Java software package that suits your computer and operating system:<br>
	<img src="images/UbInstall2.png" width="404" height="291">
	
	<p>If that doesn't work or you need to manually install Java,
	    you can find further information on the 
	    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"> Oracle Java downloads page</a>.  
	    <ul>
	    <li>Java comes in several forms: 
	    JMRI needs the Standard Edition (SE) version, but
	    Java EE is also OK;<br>
	    neither Java ME or Java Embedded are sufficient.
	    <li>There are also different Java SE installers: JMRI can
	    run with either a proper SDK (Software Development Kit, for compiling and running Java)
	    or JRE (Java Runtime Environment, for just running Java) installation.
	    </ul>
	</p>
	
	<li>Give user-level application access to serial ports<br>
	    <p>
	    <tt>chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0</tt><br>
	    <tt>chmod 666 /dev/ttyS1</tt></p>
	    </li>
	
	<li>Get JMRI</li>
	
	<p>
	Just to be safe, before installing rename your existing JMRI folder to JMRI-1 before you install the new release.
	<p>
	<img src="images/UbInstall4.png" width="465" height="155">
	<p>
	<p><a href="../download/index.shtml#prod-rel">Download</a> a version of JMRI, either the
	latest production version, or a "test version".
	<br>
	<img src="images/UbInstall3.png" width="94" height="73">
	
	<li>Installing JMRI</li>
	<p>
	Uncompress/untar the file you downloaded above. This will create a new "JMRI" folder so you should copy/move the installation file to the Home folder to make the JMRI folder there.
	<img src="images/UbInstall5.png" width="417" height="204">
	
	<p>Note: Each JMRI release is an independent set of files: It's intended to be used as a whole. Each release provides new files, and sometimes removes old files.<br>
	You should therefore not expand the download into the same place as an existing JMRI installation. Instead, expand it into a separate location, and move in to it's final destination, completely replacing any previous version of JMRI.
	<p>
	To complete the install, just move that new JMRI folder to where you want it on your computer.<br>
	<img src="images/UbInstall6.png" width="417" height="203">
	
	<p>You may have special icons or other files that you want to copy from the previous JMRI-1 folder now to the new installation. These may be in the resources folder.<br>
	<img src="images/UbInstall7.png" width="409" height="337">
	
	<li>Finishing up</li>
	<p>Next we make a start-up launcher icon from the PanelPro script.<br>
	<img src="images/UbInstall8.png" height="175" width="396"><br>
	With the mouse middle button you launch the Create Launcher, give it a name, browse to the Command file and add an informative Comment. 
	
	<p>To give your launcher an icon too, click the launching spring and pick up an icon from the resources folder (normally stored in the main JMRI folder).<br>
	Now your PanelPro as well as the other JMRI SoundPro, Throttles, DecoderPro etc. launchers look like the one below:<br>
	<img src="images/UbInstall9.png" height="174" width="379">
	
	<p>Installation is complete.<br>
	You can run the program by using the "DecoderPro", "PanelPro", or "JmriDemo" scripts in the JMRI folder. Change directory there, and invoke a script with e.g. "./DecoderPro" 
	</p>
	
	</ol>


<h2>JMRI version 2.9.2 and earlier</h2>

<p>If you are updating from a JMRI version prior to 2.9.2 then
Java needs to me "unmodified". A script for this is provided on the JMRI users Yahoo
group Files area (see below).</p>

<a id="rxtx">
<h3>RxTx</h3></a>

<p>RxTx used to be a problem requiring modifications to Java to
enable JMRI to run. Since JMRI version 3 this is no longer required. However, if
you are using a version of JMRI prior to 2.9.2 then Java must be
"unmodified". There is a script to do this in the JMRI users Yahoo Group
Files area, or one can work back from the following:</p>

<p>For those who
do not wish to use the new version, the instructions for modifying Java
are given below. If one wishes to run both, then this is simply a
matter of unmodifying or modifying Java using the scripts.

<p>The problem was that the RxTx in the Ubuntu
repositories would not work with JMRI! RXTX 2.1 uses a different structure than
RXTX 2.0; JMRI requires the RXTX 2.0 structure.
The "2.0.7pre2" is known to work well
and that is what is included in the automated script which can currently be downloaded from
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-install-5.tar.gz">Download RXTX-Install</a>
and placed
in a spare directory. Unpack it by double clicking, and then
extracting (select: "Extract") the file. 
The script is run by opening a Terminal and giving the command: <code>./RXTXinstall</code>

<p>The script will do the following:
<ul>
<li>Checks that the correct java version is installed, then copies the RXTX files to the following directories:

    <ul>
    <li>javax.comm.properties,&nbsp;ext/javax.comm.rxtx.properties, ext/comm.jar and ext/RXTXcomm.jar to
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-??/jre/lib/ and lib/ext</li>
    <li>i386/* to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-???/jre/lib/i386/</li>
    </ul>

</li>

<li>Makes a symbolic link in /i386/ so the program finds the correct
RxTx (ln -s librxtxSerial-2.0.7pre2.so librxtxSerial.so).</li>

<li>Alters the permission on dev/ttyS0 and ttyS1.</li>

<li>Backs up /etc/group and adds the user to it.</li>
</ul>
The above description is brief, but the script itself can be opened in a text editor and studied at leisure.

<p><img src="images/JMRIdirectory.png" name="graphics2" border="0" height="120" width="374"></p>

<p>When PanelPro and DecoderPro are first run the look
for a hidden directory ".jmri" in the home directory.  
If they do not find it they create it.  To see this
hidden directory in the file browser select "View" and 
"Show Hidden Files".
This directory holds the preferences. If you are
experiencing difficulties  with the program failing to start up, removing the
relevant Config2.xml file from this directory should fix it.</p>

<h3>The Environment</h3>
<p>On a fresh install the environment is OK, java
-version will give something like: 
</p>java version "1.6.0_15"<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_15-b03)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 14.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)<br><br>or<br><br>java version "1.6.0_0"<br>OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.6.1) (6b16-1.6.1-3ubuntu1)<br>OpenJDK Client VM (build 14.0-b16, mixed mode, sharing)<br><br>However
upgrading Ubuntu may create problems for JMRI releases prior to 2.9.2 as the upgrade may now point at the
"wrong" java. In this case simply run the reinstall script.<br><p></p><p><big style="font-weight: bold;">USB Ports</big>&nbsp;</p>Currently the start up scripts work "out of the box".<p>However some versions&nbsp; may need altering to get the computer to "see" a USB
port by adding "-Djavax.comm.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB0" as shown
below
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">java -noverify -Djavax.comm.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB0 -Djava.security.policy</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.html">FAQ</a> for more details.</p>

<a id="startup"><h2>Starting JMRI</h2></a>
<p>To start JMRI, open a terminal and enter ./DecoderPro or double click on the icon.</p>
<p>After a clean install, the JMRI Preferences pane will open. Select your Connection and USB port, click "Save"  and restart.</p>
More on this on the <a href="../help/en/html/setup/index.shtml">JMRI Setup help page</a>.
  <p>The JMRI <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml">Hardware help page</a> lists the various types of layout equipment that JMRI can connect to, and gives links to instruction pages. Go there next to complete your setup.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Using the Serial Ports</h3>
Dave Heap provided these instructions (February 2016):
<p>
Here are a set of instructions I use for JMRI serial ports under Ubuntu Linux. Feel free to copy and incorporate from them.
<p>
Open a Terminal window and put in this command <strong>exactly</strong>:<br>
<code>while : ;do clear;ls -lt /dev|head;i=$((i+1));echo $i;sleep 1;done</code>
<br>
Press ENTER and watch the screen as you slowly plug/unplug the USB device, watching what device appears/disappears and record the name.<br>
If nothing appears/disappears your device is not loading a driver.
<p>
You will also need to enter the following command <strong>exactly</strong>:<br>
<code>sudo adduser ${USER} dialout</code>
<br>
(This assumes "dialout" is the group shown beside your device in the list above.)
<p>
Then logout and back in again so the group membership takes effect.<br>
Next, go to JMRI Preferences -&gt; Connections and the device name you saw earlier should be in the dropdown list once you select a serial connection.</p>

<p class="important">Do not:<br>
- Try to bypass group membership by running as root. That will create further problems.<br>
- Try to change permissions of the serial port you see. They will be lost every time you plug/unplug/logout/reboot.
</p>

<p>
If you keep having problems, check the /var/lock directory and remove any stale lock files for the device. In particular this can be a problem if you have ever run JMRI as root.</p>

<h3>Errors</h3

	<dl>
	<dt>bash: ./whatever.csh: bad interpreter: No such file
	or directory
	</dt><dd>Can not run the shell: Try installing csh.
	
	</dd><dt>bash; ./cats.csh: Permission denied
	</dt><dd>Try setting the icon to executable.</dd>
	
	<dt>Port not Found.
	</dt><dd>See <a href="#notes">above</a>, but be aware that when a Java update is installed, it creates
	a new directory and alters the soft link to it. However all the
	RxTx information is left behind in the old directory. The
	solution is to run the install script again.</dd>
	</dl>
<p>If you have any problems get back to the group.</p>

<h3>CATS</h3>
<p>CATS 2.34 (Release2037) is compatible with JMRI 3.3.1 thru 3.8. We recommend that you use <a href="../releasenotes/jmri3.8.shtml">JMRI release 3.8</a> with it.
Newer releases currently do not support CATS.</p>
<p>We have carried out limited testing on CATS
with 2.9.2 and with a modified install script it runs. If you are
running CATS, one drops the zip
file into the JMRI directory, and unpacks it there. Then copy
cradic.gif and put the copy into resources. We recommend to keep
TrainStat in a separate directory. Also move CATS out of the JMRI install directory before updating JMRI in the future to prevent it being deleted by the installer.

<h3>Install;ing Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Details on installing Ubuntu can be found at <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">Ubuntu Downloads</a></p>

<p>Follow the Path "Download" and read up on the Help page which gives advice on how to download the ISO image and
then create a bootable CD to install Ubuntu.</p>
JMRI Help also has details for <a href="http://jmri.org/install/decTop.shtml">installing Xubuntu</a>.</p>

<h3>LocoBuffer USB</h3>
We recommend you use Ubuntu 8.04 or later with the LocoBuffer.
If you are planning to use Ubuntu 7.10 or older and a
<a href="http://rr-cirkits.com/locobuffer-usb/LB-manual-USB.pdf">LocoBuffer-USB</a>
from 
<a href="http://rr-cirkits.com/">RR-Cirkits</a>
you will need to download the patched
<a href="http://rr-cirkits.com/locobuffer-usb/linux/ftdi_sio.ko">ftdi_sio.ko file</a>
(right click on the link and save this file) to replace the one that came
with the distribution.
