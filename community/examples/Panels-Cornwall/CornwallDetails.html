<P>TODO</p>

JMRI was used to create the dispatcher control panel for Nick Kulp's
<a href="http://kc.pennsyrr.com/layouts/kulp/index.html">Cornwall RR</a>.
<a href="Cornwall.html">Another page</a>
briefly describes how it was done.  
This page includes additional detail on some topics.

<a id="occ"><h2>Putting occupancy sensors on the panel</h2></a>

<a id="edit"><h2>Editing the configuration file</h2></a>

The configuration file is in "XML". They look familiar to the HTML 
codes used in web pages.  
<a href="../PaneProg/ConfigFile.html#introXML">An introduction to this file format is available</a>
if you'd like to read more about it, but it's pretty self-explanatory.
Your favorite editor program should be able to work with these files, 
as they are just text.

<p>
The files are stored in different places on different types of computers.
It might be fastest to just search for the name you gave the file when you saved it.
The usual locations for preference information (if you don't change directory when
saving) is:
<ul>
    <LI>Linux - in ~/.jmri/
    <LI>Mac OS X - in the Library/Preferences/JMRI directory in your home directory
    <LI>Macintosh - in the JMRI folder within the Preferences folder within the System Folder
    <LI>Windows - in C:\Program Files\JMRI, or MyDocuments\JMRI
</ul>

<a id="turnout"><h2>Setting turnout icons</h2></a>

<a id="open"><h2>Opening a panel at program startup</h2></a>
The CornwallRR program was modified to automatically open the dispatcher
panel at startup.  This was an OK solution because that was a custom
program anyway.  But it's also possible to edit the configuration file so 
that a panel is automatically opened.
